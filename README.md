# I. COMMON NAMES RANKING

### RANK 1 = AFS and FAO/Legal common name

1. Name adapted by the AFS or the FAO and may have been adopted in the country as the official name of the species. 
2. Legal common name: This is a common name with legal status in a country such as AFS. Only one common name with rank 1 
   per species, language and country. 
3. For FAO reference:
   * All common names from FAO sources in English, Arabic, Spanish and French (considered as world languages) are tagged 
     as Global in “Country” field. 
   * But in cases of FAO common names in Chinese, Russian and Hindi or Bengali these are tagged to the corresponding 
     countries the languages are used, which are respectively, China, Russia and India.
4. If there is an AFS or FAO name already in use and a new updated reference has the same name just put a note in the 
   remarks field   i.e. “also used in Ref. XXXX.


### RANK 2 = Name used in the national or official language of the country
   Example: in the Philippines the official language is Tagalog, Filipino and English 
   i.e. Plectropomus leopardus  in Tagalog is Lapu-lapu. This common name is ranked 2.


### RANK 3 = Name used in other indigenous languages not considered official or national. 
   In the Philippines some examples of these languages are Bicolano, Visayan, Pangasinan, etc. 
   i.e. Plectropomus leopardus in other languages such as Bicolano, Visayan, Pangasinan are pugapo, labungan, and takulit, 
        respectively. These are ranked 3 . 

### RANK 4 = Name used in language not indigenous to the country but has been adopted either for its official or international use. 
   e.g. The Philippines has foreign languages it has adopted such as Spanish, Chavacano, Arabic, Malay and Chinese. Common 
        names in these languages can be ranked as 4. 

### RANK 5 = Name not displayed. These are names that are offensive or politically incorrect and shall not be displayed in any Fishbase or SealifeBase output.  
   e.g. ‘jewfish’ in FishBase



### Some points in ranking:

     
In ranking there is a need to know the languages in a certain country and which languages have an official status,
are in use widespread or are indigenous or threatened. It also helps if the population of the users of a particular language is known because it may help us to determine if this is a national, official language or it is just a commonly used language. We check the language and get the most recent and updated information on which languages are national, official, etc. We update these languages using an International Standard ISO (e.g.  Ethnologue, it has a website but you’ll need to register to access most of the information in it. It lists the current status of languages and the number of users). 


# II. NEW AND OLD ASFIS and FAO NAMES

In the case of ASFIS or FAO names which have been updated creating either a repetition of the old name or an entirely new name, 

1. If the ASFIS or FAO name has been updated and is the same as the old name record in the previous versions of ASFIS/FAO 
   then we simply change the reference number to the new one and then we put in the remarks field the old reference number 
   i.e. “also used in Ref. v. xxxx...”. 

2. If the ASFIS or FAO name has been updated and is an entirely new name for the species then we create a new record and a 
   new reference number.
   Then the old name will be tagged as FAO old in the “Type” field and the rank will be zero.   The new FAO name in the 
   current/new updated version will assume Rank 1. 



# III. THE USE OF MODIFIERS

   A modifier is a word, phrase or clause which functions as an adjective or an adverb to describe a word or make its meaning more specific. A modifier is an adjective if it modifies a noun or a pronoun and is an adverb if it modifies a verb. In our case almost always the core names we modify are nouns. 

Example:   In the common name “red king crab” the core name is ‘crab’
The first modifier is ‘king’ and the second modifier is ‘red’.

## Other points: 
1. Global is used in the “country” field when we refer to a language used in large areas 
   i.e.  Indo-Pacific, Western Central 

2. There should only be one name ranked 1 and ranked 2 in a country. One per species, language and country. Other 
   languages that are actually supposed to be ranked 2 because they are in the national language will be superseded by the 
   first name you ranked as 2 (by checking that this is in the national language and is the language with most users if 
   there are several national languages listed in Ethnologue). These other languages then will have to be ranked 3 even if 
   they are supposed to be in the 2nd rank as the rules apply, but we must follow the rule ‘one name ranked 1 and 2’ rule 
   here. 

   e.g. Tagalog, rank 2, Philippines
        English, rank 2, Philippines

   English becomes rank 3 instead even if in Ethnologue it says that English is a National language is has status 1. We 
   always follow the ‘one name ranked 1 or 2’ rule. Thus it should be 
		Tagalog, rank 2, Philippines 
		English, rank 3, Philippines

3. In the case of a reference listing 3 or more names in the national language, one of them should be ranked 2, the rest 
   should be ranked 3.  

4. Trade names are mostly for ornamental fishes. Trade name refers to fishes/nonfishes being imported hence, the name 
   ‘trade’. Tick the box if the reference says it is the trade name. 


## Assumed rules (which are based on common sense) 
1. Caution in tagging ‘Global’ to names that are found in websites and other references. 

   1.1.	Which do not say anything about the country it is from.
   
   1.2.	And the country where the name originates from is vaguely described in the reference (e.g. there are two or three 
        countries that the author included in his study and it is not indicated where the sampling was done). 
	
   1.3.	Or you cannot say for sure what country it is because there is some conflict between the site where the experiment 
        was done and the nationality of the author.
