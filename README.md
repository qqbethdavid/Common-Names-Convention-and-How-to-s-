## I. COMMON NAMES RANKING

#### RANK 1 = AFS and FAO/Legal common name

1. Name adapted by the AFS or the FAO and may have been adopted in the country as the official name of the species. 
2. Legal common name: This is a common name with legal status in a country such as AFS. Only one common name with rank 1 
   per species, language and country. 
3.


#### RANK 2 = Name used in the national or official language of the country
   Example: in the Philippines the official language is Filipino and English 
   i.e. Plectropomus leopardus  in Filipino is Lapu-lapu. This common name is ranked 2.
   Only one common name ranked 2 per species, per language and per country.


#### RANK 3 = Name used in other indigenous languages not considered official or national. 
   In the Philippines some examples of these languages are Bicolano, Ilocano, Pangasinan, etc. 
   i.e. Plectropomus leopardus in other languages such as Bicolano, Pangasinan are "pugapo", "takulit", 
        respectively. These are ranked 3. 

#### RANK 4 = Name used in language not indigenous to the country but has been adopted either for its official or international use. 
   e.g. Some foreign languages in the Philippines that are not established include Spanish, Arabic, Korean, Japanese etc. Common 
        names in these languages can be ranked as 4. 

#### RANK 5 = Name not displayed. These are names that are offensive or politically incorrect and shall not be displayed in any Fishbase or SealifeBase output.  
   e.g. ‘jewfish’ in FishBase





**Some points in ranking:**
In ranking, there is a need to know the languages in a certain country and which ones have official status, are in use widespread, or are indigenous or threatened. It may also help if the population of the users of a particular language is known because this may help to determine its status. Some tools in the web have classification and descriptions of languages that can be helpful in ranking. We can check the names with the tools that use the most recent and updated information and whose classification are based on an international standard (ISO certified, i.e. Ethnologue), (Ethnologue has a website but you will need to register to access most of the information in it. It lists the current status of languages and the number of users). 


## II. NEW AND OLD ASFIS and FAO NAMES

In the case of ASFIS or FAO names which have been updated creating either a repetition of the old name or an entirely new name, 

1. If the ASFIS or FAO names has been updated (by FAO) and these names are the same as the old name recorded in the previous versions of ASFIS/FAO 
   then we simply change the reference number to the new one and then we put in the remarks field the old reference number 
   i.e. “also used in Ref. v. xxxx...”. 

2. If the ASFIS or FAO name has been updated and is an entirely new name for the species then we create a new record and a 
   new reference number.
   The old name will be tagged as FAO old in the “Type” field and the rank will be zero.   The new FAO name in the 
   current/new updated version will assume Rank 1. 
   



### III. The use of Global in "country" field.
   Common names encountered from FAO sources in English, Arabic, Spanish and French (considered as world languages) are tagged as Global in “Country” field. 
   A common  name is also tagged as Global in the “Country” field when we refer to a language used in large areas, i.e. Indo-Pacific. But in cases of FAO common 
   names  in Chinese, Russian and Hindi or Bengali these are tagged to the corresponding countries the languages are used, which are respectively, China, 
   Russia and India.



### IV. THE USE OF MODIFIERS

   A modifier is a word, phrase or clause which functions as an adjective or an adverb to describe a word or make its meaning more specific. A modifier is an adjective if it modifies a noun or a pronoun and is an adverb if it modifies a verb. In our case almost always the core names we modify are nouns.<br/> 

Example:   In the common name “red king crab” the core name is ‘crab’
The first modifier is ‘king’ and the second modifier is ‘red’.

## Other points: 

1. There should only be one name ranked 1 and ranked 2 in a country. One per species, language and country. Other 
   languages that are existing in the database and are ranked 2 (because they are also in the national language) will be superseded by the 
   first name you ranked as 2 (by checking that this name is in the national/official language and is the language with most users if 
   there are several national languages listed in Ethnologue). These other languages then will have to be ranked 3 even if 
   these are supposed to be in the 2nd rank as the rules apply, but we must follow the rule "one name ranked 1 and 2" rule 
   here. 

   Let's say just for an example, in our database you found a species with this ranking:<br/>
   - Tagalog, rank 2, Philippines    
   - English, rank 2, Philippines

   You will need to correct this because there should only be one name ranked as 2. In this case, English becomes rank 3 instead 
   even if in Ethnologue it says that English is a National language and has status 1. We check the population speaking both 
   languages in Ethnologue. Let's say in our case Ethnologue says there are more people speaking Tagalog than English, so we
   always follow the "one name ranked 1 or 2" rule. Thus it should be<br/> 
		Tagalog, rank 2, Philippines   
		English, rank 3, Philippines

3. In the case of a reference listing 3 or more names in the national language, one of them should be ranked 2, the rest 
   should be ranked 3.  

4. Trade names are mostly for ornamental fishes. Trade name refers to fishes/nonfishes being imported hence, the name 
   ‘trade’. Tick the box if the reference says it is the trade name. 


## Assumed rules (which are based on common sense, I guess) 
1. Caution in tagging ‘Global’ to names that are found in websites and other references. We cannot tag as "Global" names 

   1.1.	Which do not say anything about the country it is from.
   
   1.2.	And the country where the name originates from is vaguely described in the reference (e.g. there are two or three 
        countries that the author included in his study and it is not indicated where the sampling was done). 
	
   1.3.	Or you cannot say for sure what country it is because there is some conflict between the site where the experiment 
        was done and the nationality of the author.
