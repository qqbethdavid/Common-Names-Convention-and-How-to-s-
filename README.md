### RANK 1 = AFS and FAO/Legal common name

1. Name adapted by the AFS or the FAO and may have been adopted in the country as the official name of the species. 
2. Legal common name: This is a common name with legal status in a country such as AFS. Only one common name with rank 1 
   per species, language and country. 
3. For FAO reference:
   * All common names from FAO sources in English, Arabic, Spanish and French (considered as world languages) are tagged 
     as Global in “Country” field. 
   * But in cases of FAO common names in Chinese, Russian and Hindi or Bengali these are tagged to the corresponding 
     countries the languages are used, which are respectively, China, Russia and India.
4. If there is an AFS or FAO name already in use and a new updated reference has the same name just put a note in the 
   remarks field   i.e. “also used in Ref. XXXX.


### RANK 2 = Name used in the national or official language of the country
   Example: in the Philippines the official language is Tagalog, Filipino and English 
   i.e. Plectropomus leopardus  in Tagalog is Lapu-lapu. This common name is ranked 2.


### RANK 3 = Name used in other indigenous languages not considered official or national. 
   In the Philippines some examples of these languages are Bicolano, Visayan, Pangasinan, etc. 
   i.e. Plectropomus leopardus in other languages such as Bicolano, Visayan, Pangasinan are pugapo, labungan, and takulit, 
        respectively. These are ranked 3 . 

### RANK 4 = Name used in language not indigenous to the country but has been adopted either for its official or international use. 
   e.g. The Philippines has foreign languages it has adopted such as Spanish, Chavacano, Arabic, Malay and Chinese. Common 
        names in these languages can be ranked as 4. 

### RANK 5 = Name not displayed. These are names that are offensive or politically incorrect and shall not be displayed in any Fishbase or SealifeBase output.  
   e.g. ‘jewfish’ in FishBase



### Some points in ranking:

     
In ranking there is a need to know the languages in a certain country and which languages have an official status,
are in use widespread or are indigenous or threatened. It also helps if the population of the users of a particular language is known because it may help us to determine if this is a national, official language or it is just a commonly used language. We check the language and get the most recent and updated information on which languages are national, official, etc. We update these languages using an International Standard ISO (e.g.  Ethnologue, it has a website but you’ll need to register to access most of the information in it. It lists the current status of languages and the number of users).
